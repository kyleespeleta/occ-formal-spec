## Abstract
The Operator Closure Constraint (OCC) is a domain-general constraint mechanism for consequence-bearing coordination systems. It states that durable settlement of obligations is bounded by a finite closure channel at the consequence interface, implemented by bounded human decision-makers operating under credible contestability. When required uncertainty reduction persistently exceeds this channel, the conserved remainder reappears as return-work (reopenings/corrections), tail thickening, off-ledger displacement, auditability/actuation collapse, and slow-variable hysteresis. This repository hosts the canonical technical preprint and supporting materials.

## What this is
This repository provides the **canonical technical specification** of OCC:
- Operational definitions (loop boundary, closure, durable settlement with reopen horizon \(T_r\))
- Observable closure accounting (initiation, attempted closure, return-work, durable settlement, debt stocks)
- Mechanism specification (finite channel, drift allocation, rate–distortion overshoot, displacement as state, auditability/actuation gate, hysteresis)
- Explicit falsification surfaces and an adversarial empirical test charter
- Tiered identifiability discipline (Tier 1/2/3) with a hard non-circularity constraint

## What this is not
- Not a point-forecasting model
- Not a universal parameter set
- Not a “physics of society”
- Not a claim that automation eliminates the constraint (it can shift the binding interface)
