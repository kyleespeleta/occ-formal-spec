# Operator Closure Constraint (OCC)

Operator Closure Constraint (OCC) is a falsifiable throughput constraint for consequence-bearing coordination. When “done” requires durable settlement through accountable human judgment under credible contestability, cognitive and energetic limits cap the rate of closure; if initiation persistently exceeds that capacity, the unmet remainder is conserved and reappears as tail thickening (delay/aging), return-work (reopen/rework), displacement, and/or degraded auditability or actuation.
